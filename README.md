DISCLAIMER: this is made using AI for a research project; all code except for app.py is from:
https://github.com/luisligunas/pinoy-dictionary-scraper

This is not made with public use in mind; so its not as user-friendly.

To run this api, you must go to the dictionary scraper link I have pasted here to set it up.
(this API only uses the tagalog dictionary json, update_filipino_dictionary.py, and modified main.yml)
